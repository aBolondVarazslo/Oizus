# Oizys Programming Language

A basic interpreted programming language designed for learning and experimentation.

## Features

- Define variables and constants  
- Basic arithmetic and logical expressions  
- `if` statements with `done` block termination  
- `null` to reset variables, `del` to delete them  
- Basic error handling for invalid syntax or usage

## Installation

Requires Python 3.x. Clone the repository and run the interpreter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oizys.git
cd oizys
python interpreter.py
```

## Limitations

- No `elif` support yet

- No functions or loops

- No complex parsing (indentation not enforced)

- Blocks must end with `done` keyword
